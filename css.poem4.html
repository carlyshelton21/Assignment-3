        <p>From childhood’s hour I have not been <br>
            As others were—I have not seen <br>
            As others saw—I could not bring <br>
            My passions from a common spring— <br>
            From the same source I have not taken <br>
            My sorrow—I could not awaken <br>
            My heart to joy at the same tone— <br>
            And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— <br>
            Then—in my childhood—in the dawn <br>
            Of a most stormy life—was drawn <br>
            From ev’ry depth of good and ill <br>
            The mystery which binds me still— <br>
            From the torrent, or the fountain— <br>
            From the red cliff of the mountain— <br>
            From the sun that ’round me roll’d <br>
            In its autumn tint of gold— <br>
            From the lightning in the sky <br>
            As it pass’d me flying by— <br>
            From the thunder, and the storm— <br>
            And the cloud that took the form <br>
            (When the rest of Heaven was blue) <br>
