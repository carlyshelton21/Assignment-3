          From childhood’s hour I have not been As others were—I have not seen
          As others saw—I could not bring My passions from a common spring— From
          the same source I have not taken My sorrow—I could not awaken My heart
          to joy at the same tone— And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— Then—in my
          childhood—in the dawn Of a most stormy life—was drawn From ev’ry depth
          of good and ill The mystery which binds me still— From the torrent, or
          the fountain— From the red cliff of the mountain— From the sun that
          ’round me roll’d In its autumn tint of gold— From the lightning in the
          sky As it pass’d me flying by— From the thunder, and the storm— And
          the cloud that took the form (When the rest of Heaven was blue) Of a
          demon in my view—
